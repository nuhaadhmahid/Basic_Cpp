    "- **Line 1**: We create a file with the extension \".cpp\". You might also come across file with the extension \".cc\". However, throughout this blog we will be using the former.\n",
    "- **Line 2**: We import the header `<iostream>`[^iostream] from the standard template library (STL). It gives us the definition of `std::cout` which we use print to the CLI, and `std::endl` which we use to print a newline character. `std` here refers to a namespace, which is a container that collects names of variables, classes, functions, etc, that are defined within it.\n",
    "- **Line 3**: We define a function called `main` with the return type `int` which stands for integer. We have to declare the type of the variable, which makes C++ a statically typed language. This `main` function is where the program starts to execute. The curved brackets `()` after `main` contains the list of parameters (in this case none), which we pass into the function. Next is the curly brackets `{}` which contains all the statements of the function. \n",
    "- **Line 4**: We pass the string `Hello, World!` followed by a newline character using `std:endl` to the object `std:cout`, which then prints out the contents passed into it to the CLI. The statement ends with a semi-colon `;`, which is case for all statements in C++ syntax.\n",
    "- **Line 5**: We returns the integer `0` from the function. `return` is a keyword in C++ which is reserved by the language. \n",
